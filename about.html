You will have the option to meet in a physical location with your tutor or meet virtually via zoom.

Once a tutoring session is complete, it is your job to \"complete\" the session by clicking complete on your appointment page. After that you will be free to rate your tutor and then clear that appointment from your page or keep it for reference.You will also be able to track your progress in-app via the \"my progress\" tab. This requires you to manually enter grades for your courses you have been tutored in, and we strongly encourage you to track your progress!For any further questions, visit the contact tab at the bottom of the page.

After that, navigate to \"set availability\" and simply click on the slots that you want to be availabel for the week. Keep in mind that you can change this schedule at any time.
